# Face_Mask_Detection

This project is implemented in Python using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. I used convolutional neural network for training.
Idea of the projects popped during the times of covid -19 where wearining mask is very important for the safety of everyone.
I thaught this particular project to be very usefull as this project can be implemented in usecases like
- In it park where people are in a huge population we can integrate this model with an iot device at the gate of every companies to see
if a person is wearing a mask or not if he is not the model will get to know that this guy isnt wearing a mask and will capture th e
information of the person as he pins his card at the gate.
- this way we can implement a very safe and amazing way to control the situation.
